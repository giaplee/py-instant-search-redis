# py-instant-search-redis
Source code example for how to build an instant search (or real-time search) with redis in python

*** Technical stack:
1. Programming language: Python
2. Backend server: Flask
3. Redis (use redis cli and redi server/redisearch):
4. Data source: you can access data source from MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, etc and then index it into redis memory

*** Deploy/Running environment
1. OS: Linux (Ubuntu or CentOS or other)
2. If you want to use/try it on Windows, you can use Docker (with a linux image)


*** Prerequisite
1. Install python environment
2. Install Flask
3. Install Redis cli and Redis server
- You can run Redis server in a Docker container instead of run in on your host (this method help you install Redis quickly)
